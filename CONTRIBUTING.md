## Content architecture contract

Challenge content lives under `modules/<moduleId>/challenges/<slug>/`. The build reads
`meta.yml` as the single source of truth and copies `README.md` and `COACH.md` into the
generated Pages data. Do not hand-edit generated files under `docs/assets/data/`; run
`npm run build` instead.

Outcome journeys live in [`outcomes.json`](outcomes.json). Use that file to curate existing
challenges into adoption, migration, security, agentic workflow, and cloud DevOps paths
without duplicating challenge content.

Every challenge directory must contain:

```text
meta.yml   # catalog metadata and dependency contract
README.md  # student guide
COACH.md   # facilitator guide, hints, expected outputs, common failures
```

### `meta.yml` required fields

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `id` | Globally unique challenge id. Use `<module>-<local-id>` (`ghec-ch01`, `ghas-02`, `ghaw-15`, `sre-agent-04`). Ids are stable and may have intentional gaps. |
| `title` | Short catalog title. |
| `module` | One of `ghec`, `ghas`, `ghaw`, `sre-agent`. |
| `track` | Track slug for the module; must match `docs/build.js` module config. |
| `difficulty` | `beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced`. |
| `duration_minutes` | Estimated student time in minutes. |
| `prerequisites` | Challenge ids that must be completed first. Empty means independent except for stated environment setup. |
| `prerequisite_capabilities` | Skills or access needed before starting; do not use this for challenge ids. |
| `description` | One-sentence catalog summary. |
| `success_criteria` | Observable outcomes that prove the challenge is complete. |
| `take_home_action` | Imperative production-adoption step the reader repeats in **their own org/tenant** (e.g. "In your own org, enforce push protection org-wide"). Plain scalar; drives real GitHub usage, not a coaching chat. |
| `take_home_owner` | Who owns the rollout: `developer`, `platform-governance`, or `solution-architect`. |
| `take_home_signal` | Observable production signal proving it landed (e.g. "Secret push protection blocks a real push in your org"). |
| `tags` | Search/filter terms. Use lowercase kebab-case where possible. |
| `app_dependency` | Runtime/sample dependency (`none`, `juice-shop`, `contoso-claims`, `contoso-app`, `seed`, or `seed-repo`). |
| `emu_compatible` | `true` when the challenge works in an EMU-controlled org; otherwise `false`. |
| `min_environment` | Lowest required scope: `org`, `repo`, or `codespace`. |
| `provision_creates` | Human-readable resources created by setup or student steps. Empty list is allowed. |
| `source_repo` | Source repository provenance. |
| `source_path` | Repository-relative source path. Do not use absolute paths or `..`. |
| `license` | Source license; currently `MIT`. |

Optional fields:

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `tier` | `setup`, `core`, `stretch`, or `bonus`. Defaults to `core` in the build. |
| `references` | Source-backed docs and product links used by students or coaches. |
| `outcomes` | Outcome ids from `outcomes.json` when a challenge needs explicit membership beyond journey curation. |
| `personas` | Personas such as `platform-engineer`, `security-lead`, `developer`, `sre`, or `migration-lead`. |
| `business_value` | Value tags such as `reduce-migration-risk`, `shift-left-security`, or `automate-repetitive-work`. |
| `adoption_stage` | `assess`, `pilot`, `scale`, or `operate`. |

## Outcome journey contract

`outcomes.json` defines the customer adoption paths shown on the home page and catalog filters.
Each outcome requires:

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable kebab-case outcome id. |
| `name` | Customer adoption journey name. |
| `tagline` | Short card summary. |
| `description` | Longer explanation of when to use the journey. |
| `personas` | Primary audience for the journey. |
| `adoption_stage` | Stages covered by the journey: `assess`, `pilot`, `scale`, `operate`. |
| `business_value` | Searchable value tags. |
| `source_platforms` | Relevant starting platforms, such as `azure-devops`, `bitbucket`, `gitlab`, `github`, or `greenfield`. |
| `challenge_ids` | Ordered list of existing challenge ids included in the journey. |
| `success_metrics` | Production-observable outcomes the customer's own team can verify in their GitHub organization or Azure tenant. |

## Per-challenge QA rubric

Use this 100-point rubric for every new or materially changed challenge. Record manual
review results in PR comments or issue bodies, not in throwaway repo planning files.

| Area | Points | Pass standard |
|---|---:|---|
| Metadata and provenance | 15 | Required fields complete; ids stable; module/track valid; source attribution present; generated catalog matches source. |
| Independence and setup | 20 | Challenge can be started from a clean environment with only listed prerequisites/capabilities; no hidden state from previous challenges; app dependency acquisition is documented. |
| Student guide quality | 20 | README has clear goal, steps, validation commands/screens, expected outputs, cleanup notes where needed, and no dead/internal-only links. |
| Coach guide quality | 15 | COACH covers facilitator intent, hints, expected solution/evidence, timing, and common failure modes without leaking secrets. |
| Validation evidence | 15 | Build/audit pass; success criteria are objectively checkable; commands are current; external dependency versions or availability claims are source-backed. |
| Accessibility and operational safety | 10 | Works in intended org/account type; calls out Azure/billing/permissions risk; avoids destructive defaults and committed secrets. |
| Catalog fit and coverage | 5 | Challenge fills a real module/track need, avoids unnecessary duplication, and has useful tags for discovery. |

Score bands:

| Score | Decision |
|---:|---|
| 90-100 | Ship-ready. |
| 75-89 | Accept with tracked follow-ups; no P0/P1 issues. |
| 60-74 | Needs revision before merge unless explicitly approved as temporary scaffold. |
| 0-59 | Reject or rebuild. |

Severity levels:

| Severity | Definition | Merge policy |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Build/audit failure, broken prerequisite graph, missing guide, unsafe instruction, secret exposure, or challenge cannot start. | Blocks merge. |
| P1 | Core learning path fails, hidden dependency, stale product instruction, dead required link, or misleading success criteria. | Blocks merge unless owner accepts documented risk. |
| P2 | Coach/student quality gap, weak evidence, missing optional metadata, incomplete cleanup, or confusing catalog fit. | May merge with assigned follow-up. |
| P3 | Editorial polish, tag improvement, minor timing mismatch, or optional reference update. | Non-blocking. |

### QA inventory format

For audit-friendly reviews, use one inventory object per challenge. JSON Lines works well
in PR comments, issue bodies, or generated local reports because it is machine-diffable
and does not require a repo planning markdown file.

```json
{"id":"ghas-02","reviewed_at":"2026-06-19T09:05:03+02:00","reviewer":"name-or-role","score":92,"severity":"P3","decision":"ship","evidence":["npm run build","npm run audit","cold-start runbook followed"],"findings":[{"severity":"P3","area":"tags","summary":"Add oauth tag if the guide gains OAuth steps."}],"missing_candidate_decision":"none"}
```

Allowed `decision` values: `ship`, `ship-with-followups`, `revise`, `reject`,
`defer`, `candidate-accepted`, `candidate-declined`.

Required inventory keys: `id`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewer`, `score`, `severity`,
`decision`, `evidence`, `findings`, `missing_candidate_decision`.

## Catalog coverage and backlog decisions

Use these rules when deciding whether a missing challenge belongs in the backlog:

1. Preserve current scoped modules before adding new scope.
2. Prefer a gap-filling challenge over a duplicate topic.
3. Do not restore intentionally removed ids unless the original scope decision is reversed.
4. If a candidate needs a new product area, create a new module/track proposal rather than
   stretching an existing module.
5. Every accepted candidate needs an owner, source/provenance, dependency plan, and QA
   inventory entry before content work starts.
